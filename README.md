# Spurpoint Messaging
## Overview
In an effort to remain compliant with the APRS.fi API usage guidelines, I have removed 
the APRS messaging features from Spurpoint. My intention is to offer Spurpoint Messaging
as a free product.  
  
When it was part of Spurpoint, the reports and messages needed to be manually copied
from the APRS module into the respective Sighting or Messaging module. So, by 
separating the APRS module out, no functionality is lost.
